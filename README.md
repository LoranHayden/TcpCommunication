# TcpCommunication
Tcp client/server with message framing
Meant to demonstrate message framing between a tcp client and server in order to ensure
each message sent to the server is completely received and processed before streaming the next chunk 
of data. Build and run the project in VS and type 'spam' in the console then hit enter.
